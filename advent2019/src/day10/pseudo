// Coords are X,Y. Top left is 0,0 and the space directly to the right is 1,0
// A monitoring station can detect any asteroid to which it has direct line of sight - that is,
// there cannot be another asteroid exactly between them 
//
// Looks like I need to detect (and discount) and asteroid that is on the exact same X, the same Y, and the same diagonal in any direction
// From the examples it looks like everything else can be counted

// Create map
// Read the map from the file given
// Loop through the whole map one space at a time
//   Is there an asteroid? If no, continue loop
//   For an asteroid, loop through the map
//     Create a new map for counting
//     For same X left, look for first asteroid. Then discount any asteroids beyond that one on X
//     For same X right, look for first asteroid. Then discount any asteroids beyond that one on X
//     For same Y up, look for first asteroid. Then discount any asteroids beyond that one on X
//     For same Y down, look for first asteroid. Then discount any asteroids beyond that one on X
//     For same X and Y northwest (X-1,Y-1), look for first asteroid. Then discount any asteroids beyond that one on X
//     For same X and Y northeast (X+1,Y-1), look for first asteroid. Then discount any asteroids beyond that one on X
//     For same X and Y southwest (X-1,Y+1), look for first asteroid. Then discount any asteroids beyond that one on X
//     For same X and Y southeast (X+1,Y+1), look for first asteroid. Then discount any asteroids beyond that one on X

//   Loop through the created map for the asteroid

//   If this is the best so far, take note of the asteroid position and the number of asteroids it can see

// Print out the best asteroid position and the number of asteroids it can see
