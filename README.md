# Advent of Code 2018 & Learning to Code again

My attempts at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) puzzles.
I'm using this as a "learning to code again" exercise since I haven't coded for 20+ years.
I've chosen [go](https://golang.org)

## Instructions

### Compiling the code

```
cd ./srv/<dayxx>
go build
```

###

## Days of Advent

+ [Day 1](srv/day01.go)
Day 1 - [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html). A few nasty hacks in part b that don't feel good, especially the "break" in the "for" loop.
```
./day01 -file original.txt -part a
./day01 -file original.txt -part b
```
